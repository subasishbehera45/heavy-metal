# heavy-metal-soil-content
Analysis of Lead (Pb) concentration across Glasgow City Region.

- The main aim of this project is to investigate the processes that leads to the accumulation of Pb in  
the topsoil and identify areas of soil contamination.

- The study uses the G_BASE dataset collected by the British Geological Survey. The dataset contains  
the contamination values in ppm along with the covariates known to have an effect on heavy metal dispersion  
and soil variation.  

- The main questions of interest are:
1. What is the spatial pattern of Pb contamination in the region of interest.
2. Are there clusters or hotspots of contamination?
3. What is the effect of the covariates on the Pb spatial pattern?

- The model in consideration, prior to the analysis is a 'Spatial Model', keeping in mind that nearby regions  
roughly get similar levels of contamination. But the efficacy of the model remains to be seen.
