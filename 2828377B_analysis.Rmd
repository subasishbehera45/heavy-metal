# Introduction {#sec:intro}

## Project Background

The research project undertakes an investigation of top-soil
concentration of the heavy-metal Lead (Pb) in the Glasgow City Region.
Small amounts of Lead can be found naturally in the soil, but
concentrations are enhanced by man-made activities. Research suggests
that lead contaminated soil and dust are the most important factors of
high blood lead level(Lanphear, B. P. et al., 1997). Adverse health
problems from high blood lead level has been well documented through out
the world. Chronic exposure to low-level lead has been linked to several
developmental problems, especially for pre-school children(Needleman H.
L., et al., 1990). There is still much on-going research to solidify the
relationship between lead amount found in soil and amount that is
absorbed by humans through exposure.

## Aims and Objectives

The primary objective of this report is to investigate the processes
that lead to accumulation of Pb in the top-soil of the Glasgow City
Region. This broad objective can be divided into four sub-objectives
that will provide more insight into the underlying factors:

1.  To identify the spatial pattern of Pb contamination in the Glasgow
    area.\
2.  To identify clusters of contamination, if there exists any.\
3.  To quantify the effects of co-variates on the Pb concentration.\

The objectives render the research problem as firstly a spatial problem
where the concentration values are mapped across the study region. This
is followed by a regression problem which may or may not involve
adjusting for a spatial component depending on the strength of
correlation between response variable. The completion of the objectives
has social-importance as it will help the officials investigate highly
contaminated areas and use the predictions to identify potentially
hazardous areas. This is aimed at sustainable development and planning
for the Glasgow City Region.

## Description of the data {#sec:datadesc}

The study area includes each of the eight local councils that constitute
the Glasgow City region, i.e. Glasgow City council, Invercylde council,
Renfrewshire council, East Renfrewshire council, East Dunbartonshire
council, West Dunbartonshire council, North Lanarkshire council, and
South Lanarkshire council. The data used in this project is a subset
derived from a wide range of datasets collected by the British
Geological Survey (BGS) between 2001 and 2011 for the Geo-chemical
Baseline Survey of the Environment (G-BASE) project. This served as the
foundation for the multi-disciplinary project titled 'Clyde Basin Urban
Super Project' (CUSP) which was carried out in an attempt to provide
sustainable planning and development in Scotland's major urban areas.

The soil survey in the Clyde Basin for the CUSP was conducted in two
parts.The first part included sample collection from the urban and
sub-urban area of Glasgow city in 2001-2002. The second part included
sample collection from the remaining urban cities in the study region
and also the rural areas.

The Co-ordinate Reference System used for this data is British National
Grid (EPSG: 27700) which presents the co-ordinates in Easting and
Northing. The response variable under study is the top-soil Pb
concentration in the Glasgow City Region, which is measured in parts per
million (ppm). Along with the concentration value, other co-variates
relating to the location of sample were also collected. The co-variates
involved and their short description is given in Table \ref{tab:table1}.

# Description of Statistical Methods {#sec:methoddesc}

## Ordinary Least Squares Linear Model

Linear regression is referred to as a parametric approach for modelling
a scalar response variable (also referred to as dependent variable)
using one or more explanatory variables (also called independent
variables). This statistical model models the linear relationship
between the response and explanatory variables and takes the parametric
form:

$$y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_{1}x_{1i} + \beta_{2}x_{2i} + \ldots + \beta_{p}x_{pi} + \epsilon_i, ~~~~ \epsilon_i \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2) ~~~ i = 1, \ldots, n$$

The above equation is often expressed in a very convenient vector-matrix
form as follows:

$$Y = X\beta~+~\epsilon, ~~~ where~E(\epsilon) = \vec0~and~Var(\epsilon) = \Sigma $$
also, $$\sum = \begin{bmatrix} \sigma^2 & 0 & 0 & \ldots & 0\\
0 & \sigma^2 & 0 & \ldots & 0 \\
\vdots & \vdots & \vdots & &\vdots
\\0 & 0 & 0 & \ldots & \sigma^2
\end{bmatrix}$$

The $\Sigma$ is termed as the associated variance-covariance matrix of
the error terms.

Now, it is also mathematically equivalent to notate the above
information as follows: $$Y \sim \mathcal{N}(X\beta, \Sigma) $$

The beta parameters are estimated by the method of least-squares, which
minimizes the sum of squared errors given by:

$$S(\beta) = \sum_{i}(y_i~-~x_{i}^T\beta)^2~=~(Y-X\beta)^T(Y-X\beta)$$\
The minimization of the above equation gives the estimated beta
parameters, which in vector-matrix notation is given by:

$$\hat{\beta} = (X^TX)^{-1}(X^TY) $$ By extension, the estimated errors
(residuals) is calculated as $\hat\epsilon = (Y - X\hat\beta)$

It is best practice to include an interval of estimates which provides a
range of plausible values with some confidence, rather than a single
estimate. The interval, called the confidence interval is calculated for
the beta parameters as follows:

$$\hat\beta_i \pm~t(n-p, \frac{\alpha}{2})\sqrt{(\boldsymbol{X}^T\boldsymbol{X})^{-1}_{ii}}$$
where, t(.) refers to the Student's t-distribution with $n-p$ degrees of
freedom, $\alpha$ refers to the significance level (often, though not
necessarily set to 5%), $\text{S.E}(\beta_i)$ refers to the standard
error of the beta parameters.

There are a certain number of assumptions associated with this modelling
approach, which are stated as:

-   The mean of the error terms $\epsilon_i$ is zero.

-   The variance of the error terms is constant for all values of
    independent variables.

-   The errors are independent for all observations.

-   The errors have a normal distribution.

The assumption of independent errors gives a certain structure to the
variance-covariance of the population under study. The off-diagonal
elements of the variance-covariance matrix(given by $\Sigma$ above) is 0
indicating independence of the errors. This assumption of independent
errors is certainly not true for situations where the data under study
has some temporal or spatial correlation. The correlation of the values
of response variable indicates that when a statistical model is employed
to model these data, the residuals generated will have some degree of
correlation and the off-diagonal elements in the variance-covariance
matrix will not be zero anymore, but rather will have a value dependent
on the inherent correlation structure of the data (which is often
unknown and estimated).

## Spatial Model: accommodating spatial autocorrelation

When the data used in a study has an inherent spatial correlation, the
assumption of independent errors is violated and thus, is needed to be
addressed. The way to incorporate the spatial correlation is discussed.

The first Law of Geography, as stated by Waldo Tobler goes as follows:

$"Everything~is~related~to~everything~else,~but~near~things~are~more~related~than~distant~things."$

This adage serves as the foundation upon which spatial modelling
resides. So, the degree to which the two values will be correlated in a
spatial setting will depend on how far the two values reside in space
i.e., the distance. There are a number of distance metrics available
that allows a practitioner to quantify how far the values reside, and
again, depending on the type of data being modeled, one is preferred
over another.

### Geostatistical Process:

The spatial process appropriate and therefore used for the data in hand
is called the 'geostatistical process', which is defined as:\

$${Y(\textbf{s}): \textbf{s} \in D}$$ where $D$ serves as a subset of
the 2-dimensional space $\mathbb{R^2}$, i.e., the study region. The
locations $\textbf{s}$ = $(s_1, s_2)$ varies continuously over the
region $D$, but in practice only a sample of locations are selected and
rest of the locations are generally needed to be predicted with some
approximation of spatial smoothness.

The covariance of values at two locations is given by:
$$C(\textbf{s}, \textbf{t}) = Cov[Y(\textbf{s}), Y(\textbf{t})] \\ =E(Y(\textbf{s})Y(\textbf{t})) - \mu(\textbf{s})\mu(\textbf{t})$$
where $\mu(\textbf{.})$ = $E(Y(\textbf{s}))$ i.e., the expected value of
the process at that location.

### Process Model:

The continuous response variables is assumed to follow a gaussian
process. So, the vector of response values
$[Y(\boldsymbol{s_1}), Y(\boldsymbol{s_2}) \ldots~Y(\boldsymbol{s_n})]$
at n locations is denoted in a vector-matrix form as:

$$Y \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu, \boldsymbol{\Sigma)}$$ for a mean vector
$\boldsymbol{\mu}$ and variance-covariance matrix $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}$.
The structure of the variance-covariance matrix is different from the
one used in Ordinary Least Squares model. Using some generality, the
structure of the variance-covariance matrix is given by:

$$\sum = \begin{bmatrix} \sigma^2 & f(d_{12}) & f(d_{13}) & \ldots & f(d_{1n})\\
f(d_{21}) & \sigma^2 & f(d_{23}) & \ldots & f(d_{2n}) \\
\vdots & \vdots & \vdots & &\vdots
\\f(d_{n1}) & f(d_{n2}) & f(d_{n3}) & \ldots & \sigma^2
\end{bmatrix}$$

where $d_{ij}$ represents the distance between $i^{th}$ and $j^{th}$
sample location and $f$ is a function that maps that distance to some
function that quantifies the correlation e.g. and exponential function.
This function $f$ incorporates all the necessary information about the
correlation structure assumed to be present in the data. This
variance-covariance structure allows a practitioner to include the
correlation information between the values based on a distance metric
and hence, the First Law of Geography is presented here in a quantified
manner.

Certain assumptions are made about the geostatistical process before
modelling the data. These include the assumption of weak-stationarity
and isotropy.

The process is weakly-stationary if:

-    it has constant mean throughout the study region i.e., the mean is
    not dependent on the location. Mathematically,
    $E(Y(\textbf{s}) = \mu ~\forall~ \textbf{s}$

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   the covariance (and therefore, correlation) between two sample
    values is a finite constant and only only depends on the
    displacement vector between the two locations, which is
    mathematically stated as,
    $Cov[Y(\textbf{s}),Y(\textbf{t})] = C(\textbf{h})$, where
    $\textbf{h}$ = $||\textbf{t}-\textbf{s}||$.

A further assumption regarding the covariance is made which leads to
'isotropy'. The process is isotropic in nature if:\

-   the covariance between two sample values only depends on the
    euclidean distance between the two sample locations and is
    independent of the direction at which two sample locations are
    considered i.e.,
    $C(\textbf{h}) = C(~||\textbf{h}|| = \sqrt{h_1^2 + h_2^2}~)$.

The covariance structure of the $\boldsymbol\Sigma$ depends on certain
parameters that are estimated from the data and thus, is written as
$\boldsymbol\Sigma(\boldsymbol{\theta})$, where
$\boldsymbol\theta = [\sigma^2~\tau^2~\phi]$.\

-   $\sigma^2$ is called partial sill and is defined as the amount of
    smooth variation in the data.\
-   $\tau^2$ is called nugget effect and is defined as the amount of
    random variation present in the data.\
-   $\phi$ is called range parameter and is the defined as the distance
    at which the sample points become uncorrelated.

The most commonly used covariance models used to model the spatial
autocorrelation are as follows:

$$\boldsymbol\Sigma(\boldsymbol\theta) = \sigma^2\text{exp}(-\textbf{D}/\phi) + \tau^2\textbf{I} \hskip5ex(Exponential~ model)$$\
$$\boldsymbol\Sigma(\boldsymbol\theta) = \sigma^2\text{exp}(-\textbf{D}^2/\phi) + \tau^2\textbf{I} \hskip5ex(Gaussian~ model)$$

$$\boldsymbol\Sigma(\boldsymbol\theta) = \sigma^2[1-\frac{3}{2}(\textbf{D}/\phi)~+~\frac{1}{2}(\textbf{D}/\phi)^3] + \tau^2\textbf{I} \hskip5ex(Spherical~ model)$$

The choice of covariance model is based on a model fitting criterion
such as AIC, BIC, or by their predictive ability using cross-validation.

### Detecting spatial autocorrelation

The correlation component in the spatial data is assessed using a
Semi-Variogram. It is a plot of 'Semi-Variance' against distance which
tells the practitioner whether or not a spatial model is adequate for
the data. Semi-variance, in simple terms, is defined as a measure of
dissimilarity between two sample values at a certain distance.
Mathematically, semi-variance for a spatial process is stated as:

$$\gamma(s,t) = \frac{1}{2}\text{Var}[Y(s)-Y(t)]$$

As the semi-variogram is a population measure, an estimate is used in
place, called binned empirical semi-variogram. The method to create a
binned empirical semi-variogram is as follows:

-   the statistical range of distances between all pairs of values
    respective to its co-ordinates is calculated and categorized into k
    intervals.

-   For each interval, considering all values that lie within it, sum of
    squared difference between all pairs of points are calculated and is
    divided by $2|N(h_k)|$, where $|N(I_k)|$ is the total number of
    values or points within that interval, i.e.

$$\frac{1}{2|N(h_k)|}\Sigma[y(s)-y(t)]^2$$

-   The above values are plotted against the midpoint of each interval.

-   Along with the binned empirical semi-variogram, a Monte-Carlo
    envelope is calculated that simulates the upper and lower bound of
    semi-variance values expected at each distance under randomness.

-   When this is calculated for each of the four direction, it is called
    a directional semi-variogram and helps to assess the isotropy
    assumption.

The way to interpret this estimate of semi-variogram is, if
semi-variance values lie outside the estimated upper and lower bounds,
then there is evidence of spatial auto-correlation in the data. For the
directional semi-variogram, if the semi-variogram looks reasonably
similar at each direction, isotropy assumption is validated. The binned
empirical semi-variogram is only assessed at shorter distances
(generally half the maximum distance) as the estimated bounds are
unstable for larger distances.

There is a close relationship between the covariance structure and
semi-variance as one determines the other. Thus, different covariance
structures give different variogram models, which results to different
shapes of binned empirical semi-variogram. Using the definitions, the
relationship is expressed mathematically as:

$$\gamma(\boldsymbol{s},\boldsymbol{t})= \frac{1}{2}Var[Y(\boldsymbol{s})-Y(\boldsymbol{t})]\\ \hskip5ex =
\frac{1}{2}[Var(Y(\boldsymbol{s})+Var(Y(\boldsymbol{t})) - 2Cov(\boldsymbol{s}, \boldsymbol{t}))]$$

Under the assumptions of isotropy and weak stationarity, the equation
can be further reduced to:

$$\gamma(h) = C(0)-C(h)$$

### Estimating Parameters

The spatial process
$$Y = [Y(\boldsymbol{s_1})\ldots~Y(\boldsymbol{s_n})] \sim \mathcal{N}(\boldsymbol\mu(\boldsymbol{s}), \boldsymbol\Sigma(\boldsymbol\theta))$$
has two classes of parameters that are estimated from the data. The mean
function $\boldsymbol\mu(\boldsymbol{s)}$ is modeled via a linear
approach and takes the parametric form $X\boldsymbol\beta$ which is
similar to the one seen in OLS model. The other class of parameters
specific to the spatial model is the ones in the covariance structure
i.e $\boldsymbol\Sigma(\boldsymbol\theta)$ as defined above.

The beta parameters are estimated in such a way that it incorporates the
information of spatial correlation. The estimation can be conducted
either by Maximum Likelihood Estimation or a Bayesian Approach, but the
software used for the analysis of data in hand uses the Maximum
Likelihood approach. The general form of the estimated beta parameters
is as follows:

$$\hat{\boldsymbol\beta}(\phi, \sigma^2,\tau^2) = (\boldsymbol{X}^TV(\phi, \sigma^2,\tau^2)\boldsymbol{X})^{-1}\boldsymbol{X}^TV(\phi, \sigma^2,\tau^2)\boldsymbol{Y}$$
where, the expression for $V(.)$ varies for each covariance model, but
it is always dependent on the three covariance parameters. The closed
form solution is reminiscent of the OLS model solution, but differs from
that as it includes the extra $V(.)$ term to include the spatial
correlation information. The estimates of the $(\sigma^2, \tau^2, \phi)$
are calculated from the data and plugged into the above formula to
estimate the beta parameters.

The confidence intervals can be calculated after the model fitting to
assess the uncertainty associated with the estimated parameter value:

$$\hat\beta_i(\hat\phi, \hat\sigma^2, \hat\tau^2)\pm~t(n-p, \frac{\alpha}{2})\sqrt{(\boldsymbol{X}^TV(\hat\phi, \hat\sigma^2, \hat\tau^2)\boldsymbol{X})^{-1}_{ii}}$$

It is noteworthy that uncertainty intervals are only available for the
mean model parameters i.e. beta parameters and no interval is generated
for the covariance parameters.

The spatial model, by definition includes spatial autocorrelation and
the estimates for the response values will be correlated depending on
the strength of the correlation in the data as picked up the model,
which implies that the residuals will also be correlated for the fitted
values.Thus, the residuals need to be de-correlated and checked for
independence, in order to assess whether spatial correlation is properly
accounted by the model. This is done by decomposition of the
variance-covariance matrix(e.g. by Singular Value Decomposition). The
new residuals calculated are called 'innovations' and these will be used
at the end to assess whether the model has properly accounted the
spatial autocorrelation in the data.

### Effects of Ignoring Spatial Correlation

The most important consequence of naively ignoring the inherent spatial
auto-correlation that may be present in the data, is the underestimation
of uncertainty intervals. The assumption of independence between the
observations, when there is some correlation, reduces the coverage of
the intervals.(Ferraciolli M. A., Bocca F. F., Rodrigues L. H. A.). This
is because the model assumes there are more independent pieces of
information than there actually is. Thus, this could mislead the
practitioners to be more certain about the predictions, when more
uncertainty is warranted.

### Summary of the Model Fitting Steps

After the data cleaning and exploratory analysis phase, the analysis
moves to model fitting. The steps involved in this phase can be
summarized as follows:

-   Fit an Ordinary Least Squares model to the data using a variable
    selection strategy assuming no spatial autocorrelation.

-   Calculate the residuals, perform model diagnostics (except for the
    correlated residuals assumption) and re-iterate step 1 if required.

-   After removing the linear trend due to co-variates via model
    fitting, plot the residuals against the co-ordinates to spot the
    inherent spatial trends and clusters.

-   Using the residuals, also plot the binned empirical semi-variogram
    to look for evidence of spatial autocorrelation and interpret the
    plot accordingly.

-   If evidence is found, use the spatial model to incorporate the
    autocorrelation. Using a model fitting criterion (e.g. AIC) choose
    the appropriate covariance model.

-   After the spatial model is finalized and calculate the innovations.
    Use the innovations to create a binned empirical semi-variogram.
    Interpret the plot accordingly.

## Data preparation {#sec:dataprep}

The number of samples provided in the dataset is `r nrow(lead_data2)`. A
skewness coefficient of `r round(skewness(lead_data2$Pb, na.rm = T), 3)`
and the adjoining box-plot and density plot suggested a transformation
of the variable before analysis. Log base-2 transformation was applied
and the result of the transformation is presented in the graph below.

```{r Pbboxplot, fig.cap = '\\label{fig:transformplot} Effect of $log_2$ transformation on Pb variable', fig.pos = 'h', fig.height=4}
pbbox <- lead_data2_main %>% ggplot(aes(x = Pb)) + geom_boxplot() +
  theme_bw(12) + labs(title = 'Box-plot of Pb') +
  theme(title = element_text(size = 10))

pbdensity <- lead_data2_main %>% ggplot(aes(x = Pb)) + geom_density() +
  theme_bw(12) + labs(title = 'Density Plot') +
  theme(title = element_text(size = 10))

lpbbox <- lead_data2_main %>% ggplot(aes(x = log2_Pb)) + geom_boxplot() +
  theme_bw(12) + labs(title = expression(paste('Box-plot of Pb at ','log'[2], ' scale')), x = expression(paste('log'[2], ' Pb'))) +
  theme(title = element_text(size = 10))

lpbdensity <- lead_data2_main %>% ggplot(aes(x = log2_Pb)) + geom_density() +
  theme_bw(12) + labs(title = expression(paste('Density plot of Pb at ','log'[2], ' scale')), x = expression(paste('log'[2], ' Pb')))+
  theme(title = element_text(size = 10))

grid.arrange(pbbox, pbdensity, lpbbox, lpbdensity, nrow = 2)

```

After the transformation, thirty outliers were spotted and were
separated out to a different dataset to reduce noise for the statistical
models. These outliers were analyzed differently after the analysis of
non-outlier data points. 3-Standard Deviation rule was applied to locate
an outlier. A total of 26 missing values were found in the response
variable. Since the process being studied is roughly contiguous in
nature, K-Nearest Neighbor using K = 5 was implemented to impute those
missing values. Corresponding county information was collected from the
shape file which will allow between and within county analysis. Based on
evidence shown in plots \ref{fig:countyconf} and \ref{fig:heatmap}, two
new features were created and the rationale for which is explained in
the section \ref{sec:trend}.

## Spatial Trends and Clusters {#sec:trend}

The map of the Pb concentration with their corresponding sample location
is provided below:

![](lead_conc_py2.png "Map of Lead Concentration at sample locations.")

The data used in the plot is in log base-2 scale but another colorbar
relative to original scale is also provided so as not to skew any
interpretation. The locations of outliers are marked in black. There
were no clusters of outliers which tells us that these unusual values
were not from specific regions. Some features of the map are noteworthy.
Evidently some clusters can be seen, specifically in the Glasgow City
Region. A short term spatial correlation is also evident as sample
locations near to each other have roughly similar values. No clear trend
is apparent from this map.

```{r avgtable}
lead_data2_main %>% filter(county != 'NONE') %>% group_by(county) %>%
  summarise(Min = min(Pb), Q1 = quantile(Pb, 0.25), Mean = mean(Pb),
            median = median(Pb), Q3 = quantile(Pb, 0.75), Max = max(Pb),
            Stdev = sd(Pb), SampleSize = n()) %>%
  kable(caption = '\\label{tab:pbsummary} Summary Statistics of Pb for each county.', digits = 2, ) %>%
  kable_styling(font_size = 10, latex_options = 'hold_position', full_width = F) %>%
  
  row_spec(0, bold= T)
```

The summary statistics for Pb concentration across county is given by
the table \ref{tab:pbsummary}. Some points to note are as follows:

-   The sample size for each county is large, so the summary statistics
    and any relevant inferences made are valid.

-   The median for Glasgow City Council is higher than any other
    counties.

-   The variability for each county is roughly similar as shown by the
    standard deviation measure.

Because of the high skewness in the Pb concentrations, values at log
scale are used for analysis hereafter unless specified otherwise. A 95%
confidence interval along with the mean for each county is shown by the
graph below.

```{r countyconf, fig.pos = 'h', fig.height=3, fig.cap= '\\label{fig:countyconf} Mean Values with uncertainty interval across Counties.'}

county_interval <- lead_data2_main %>% group_by(county) %>%
  summarise(mean = mean(log2_Pb), lower = mean(log2_Pb) - qt(0.975, n() - 1)*(sd(log2_Pb)/sqrt(n())),
            upper = mean(log2_Pb) + qt(0.975, n() - 1)*(sd(log2_Pb)/sqrt(n())),
            n = n() )

county_interval %>% filter(county != 'NONE') %>%
  ggplot(aes(y = fct_reorder(county, mean), x = mean)) + 
  geom_point() +
  labs(y = NULL, x = expression(paste('log'[2], ' Pb')))+
  geom_errorbar(aes(xmin = lower, xmax = upper), width = 0.5) +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(title = element_text(size = 10))
```

Since log transformations are one-to-one transformations of the measure,
the values can be directly converted to original scale by raising each
of them to the power of 2. Direct inferences could be made on
differences of means for each county based on whether or not there is
overlap between the intervals. Glasgow City, Inverclyde, and
Renfrewshire councils make a cluster in the high concentration side.
This suggest feature engineering to create an indicator variable
indicating whether the observation corresponds to these counties in
order to allow the statistical models recognize the signals in the data.
The variable is referred to as `High Concentration County` in the report
wherever necessary. There are a total of 13 categories in `Landuse`
variable used in the dataset. The frequency of the categories is
depicted in the bar graph \ref{fig:landusebar}.

```{r landusebar, fig.pos = 'h', out.height='30%', fig.cap=  "\\label{fig:landusebar}. Mean Pb concentration in $log_2$ scale with samples sizes labelled.", out.width='70%', fig.align = 'center'}

lead_data2_main %>% group_by(Landuse) %>%
  summarise(mean.logpb = mean(log2_Pb), n = n()) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = fct_reorder(Landuse, n), y = mean.logpb)) +
  geom_col(fill = 'white', color = 'black') +
  geom_text(aes(label = n), position = position_dodge(width = 0.9), vjust= 1.5) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 8, 1)) +
  labs(x = 'Landuse', y = expression(paste('Mean log'[2], ' Pb'))) +
  theme_bw() + theme(title = element_text(size = 10))
```

\newpage

The average Pb concentration varies little in cases of high
concentration categories, with the exception of `Landuse` category
\`19\` , but the sample size is low in relation to statistical
standards. The interaction of `Landuse` and `County` variables is well
visualized by the graph \ref{fig:heatmap} which gives a heatmap of
concentration across `Landuse` and \`County\` variable. Low sample size
categories were removed before plotting.

```{r heatmap, fig.pos = 'h', out.height='30%', out.width='70%', fig.cap= "\\label{fig:heatmap} Heatmap of Pb concentation across Counties and Landuse", fig.align = 'center'}

lead_data2_main %>% filter((Landuse %in% c(1, 3, 4, 20, 21)) & (county != 'NONE')) %>%
  group_by(Landuse, county) %>% summarise(mean.logpb = mean(log2_Pb)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(Landuse, county, fill = mean.logpb)) +
  geom_raster() +
  scale_fill_gradientn(colors = brewer.pal(9, 'YlOrRd')) +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(x = 'Landuse',y = NULL,  fill = expression(paste('Mean', ' log'[2], ' Pb', '\n'))) +
  theme()

```

```{r landusedf, include = F}
landuse_analysis <- lead_data2_main %>% filter(Landuse %in% c(1, 3, 4, 20, 21)) %>%
  select(log2_Pb, Pb, Landuse, county)
```

The categories 20 and 21 generally had high level of Pb concentration
across all counties and, also had little differences in their summary
statistics. Based on this fact, another feature was created indicating
whether the `Landuse` was 20 or 21, which is referred to as
`landuse2021` wherever necessary. As already implied by the figure
\ref{fig:countyconf}, the counties Glasgow City, Renfrewshire and
Inverclyde had high concentration values irrespective of the type of
land.

\newpage

An Ordinary Least Squares model was implemented to remove the linear
trend by the recorded co-variates. A forward variable selection strategy
was used to select the variables and build the OLS model. 5%
significance level was chosen in order to select the significant
variables. The summary of the final chosen OLS model is given in the
table \ref{tab:ols}. Using this, potential predictive co-variates for
the spatial model were chosen.

```{r olsmodel, include = T}
lead_data2_main <- lead_data2_main %>% mutate(landuse2021 = as.factor(as.numeric(Landuse %in% c(20, 21))),
                           high_conc_county = as.factor(as.numeric(county %in% c('Glasgow City', 'Renfrewshire', 'Inverclyde'))))

model1 <- lm(data = lead_data2_main, log2_Pb ~ Y + Elevation + MRRTF + Population +  high_conc_county + landuse2021)

model1_table <- cbind(c("", "Intercept", "Y", "Elevation", "MRRTF", "Population", "High concentration county", "20 or 21 Landuse"),
           c( "Estimate", sprintf("%.7f", model1$coefficients)), 
           c("P-value", "$ 5.86 \\times 10^{-12}$", "$1.97 \\times 10^{-4}$", "$2 \\times 10^{-16}$", "$7.02 \\times 10^{-9}$", "$2.87 \\times 10^{-15}$", "$1.22 \\times 10^{-5}$", "$1.46 \\times 10^{-3}$")
           ) #later add interpretation to the table

model1_table <- rbind(model1_table, c("$\\textbf{Adjusted R-squared}$", 0.135, ""))

model1_table %>% kable(align="c", escape = F, caption = "\\label{tab:ols} Summary of the OLS model") %>%
  kable_styling("hover", full_width = F, font_size = 11, latex_options = "hold_position") 
```

Residual analysis, via diagnostic plots allowed to confirm that the
model assumptions associated with non-spatial model are satisfied. The
diagnostic plots are provided in the plot \ref{fig:olsdiagnostic}.

```{r olsdiagnostic, fig.pos= 'h', fig.cap = '\\label{fig:olsdiagnostic} Diagnostic Plots for the fitted OLS Model.', out.width= '70%', out.height= '70%', fig.align = 'center'}
par(mfrow = c(2, 2))
plot(model1, ask = F, which = c(1, 2, 4, 5))

```

From the plots, it is seen that the residuals are evenly spread out
around the value zero, do not exhibit any pattern to indicate
non-linearity or non-constant variance, and are roughly normally
distributed as seen from the Q-Q plot. The cook's distance for all
observations are also less than 1 indicating none of them are potential
outliers. The independence of the errors will be assessed with the
binned empirical semi-variogram.

The plot of residuals against co-ordinates in the figure
\ref{fig:geoplot} suggests no apparent spatial trend in the East-West or
North-South direction. The first of the four plots uses quantiles to
color-code the residuals, using which one could see some clusters in
data region. The density plot reveals the normality of residuals which
was shown in figure \ref{fig:olsdiagnostic} Q-Q plot.

```{r residgeo, include=F}
#calculate residuals
model1.resid <- residuals(model1)

#create a dataframe containing residuals, longitude and latitude
model1.usedXY <- lead_data2_main %>% select(-Aspect) %>% drop_na() %>% select(X, Y)

model1_resid_data <- data.frame(resid = model1.resid, 
                                easting = model1.usedXY$X, northing = model1.usedXY$Y)

#create geodata data type
model1_resid_geodata <- as.geodata(model1_resid_data, coords.col = 2:3, data.col = 1, borders = F)
#plot(model1_resid_geodata)

quart <- function(x){
  quantile(x, c(0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1))
}

#bin the residuals to appropriate quantiles
model1_resid_data <- model1_resid_data %>% mutate(quant.resid = cut(resid, quart(resid)))

#create the variogram to assess spatial correlation
model1_resid_variog <- variog(model1_resid_geodata)

#create the Monte-carlo envelope
model1_resid_mc <- variog.mc.env(model1_resid_geodata, obj.variog = model1_resid_variog, nsim = 200)

#calculate directional variogram 
model1_resid_dirvar <- variog4(model1_resid_geodata)

```

```{r residplot, fig.cap = '\\label{fig:geoplot} Residual Analysis for Clusters and Trends.', out.width= '80%', out.height='70%', fig.align = 'center'}
p1 <- model1_resid_data %>% ggplot(aes(easting, northing, color = quant.resid)) +
  geom_point(size = 1) + theme_bw() +
  theme(legend.position = 'none') + scale_color_brewer(type = 'div') +
  labs(x = 'Eastings', y = 'Northings')

p2 <- model1_resid_data %>% ggplot(aes(easting, resid)) +
  geom_point() + theme_bw() + labs(x = 'Eastings', y = 'Residuals')

p3 <- model1_resid_data %>% ggplot(aes(northing, resid)) +
  geom_point() + theme_bw() + labs(x = 'Northing', y = 'Residuals')

p4 <-model1_resid_data %>% ggplot(aes(x = resid)) +
  geom_density() + theme_bw() + labs(x = 'Residuals')

grid.arrange(p1, p2, p3, p4, nrow = 2)

```

The short term spatial auto-correlation is assessed by the figure
\ref{fig:variograms}. The semi-variance at euclidean distance less than
\~5000 lies outside the Monte-Carlo envelope suggesting very short term
correlation, which needed to be addressed. Thus the OLS model is
adjusted accordingly to incorporate that information. Again, for short
distances, the directional variogram for each direction seems quite
similar, thus validating the isotropy assumption.

```{r plot capture, include=F}
plot(model1_resid_dirvar, legend = F)
legend('bottomleft', legend = c('0Â°', '45Â°', '90Â°', '135Â°'), col = c('black', 'red', 'green', 'blue'), lty = 2, bty = 'n')
title('Directional Variogram', cex.main = 1)
divariog <- recordPlot()
```

```{r vardirvar, fig.cap = '\\label{fig:variograms} Empirical Variogram and Directional variogram to assess .', fig.pos= 'h', fig.align='center', out.height='50%', fig.align='center', out.width='90%'}

variog <- data.frame(variog.u = model1_resid_variog$u, variog.v = model1_resid_variog$v,
           upper = model1_resid_mc$v.upper, lower = model1_resid_mc$v.lower) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = variog.u, y = variog.v)) + geom_point() +
  geom_line(aes(y = upper), linetype = 'dashed') +
  geom_line(aes(y = lower), linetype = 'dashed') +
  geom_point(aes(x = variog.u[1], y = variog.v[1]), pch = 21, size = 6, color = 'red') +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(0, 10000, 20000, 30000, 40000, 50000, 60000))+
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0.5, 1.5, 0.15)) + 
  labs(x = 'Distance', y = 'Semivariance', title = 'Empirical Variogram of OLS Model residuals') +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(title = element_text(size = 10)) +
  xlim(c(0, 50000))

plot_grid(variog, divariog, ncol= 2)
```

## Effects of Co-variates on Spatial Pattern

Following the evidence of short-term spatial correlation among the
values of concentration, a spatial model with exponential correlation
structure was fitted at first. The choice of co-variates to be used was
decided from the significant variables in the OLS model and the choice
of correlation structure was arbitrary, but is almost always the default
choice in spatial models.

```{r geodat, include = F}
#create geodata data type for spatial model
lead_data2_main.geodata <- as.geodata(lead_data2_main %>% select(-Aspect),
                                      coords = 1:2, data.col = 14,
                                      covar.col = c(3:13, 15:16), borders =F)

#confidence interval function
confIntSpatial <- function(model){
  std_error <- sqrt(diag(model$beta.var))
  df <- length(lead_data2_main.geodata$data) - (model$npars - length(model$cov.pars) - 1)
  
  cbind(
    (model$beta - qt(0.975, df)*std_error),
    (model$beta + qt(0.975, df)*std_error)
  )
}

#running the model takes ~25 minutes
#model was saved as R object in a .RDS file and is loaded
#when required.

#spatial_model4.0 <- likfit(lead_data2_main.geodata,
                           #trend = ~Y + Elevation + MRRTF + Population + landuse2021 + high_conc_county,
                           #ini.cov.pars = c(0.25, 6000),
                           #fix.nugget = F, cov.model = 'exponential')

#saveRDS(spatial_model4.0, 'spatial_model_exp.rds')

#check the uncertainty intervals for beta parameters
spatial_model4.0 <- readRDS('spatial_model_exp.rds')
spatial_confint <- as.data.frame(confIntSpatial(spatial_model4.0))

#reduce the co-variates used in the model to include
#only significant co-variates.

```

```{r coeftable, include = T}
spat_mod_table <- cbind(c("", "Intercept", "Y", "*Elevation", "*MRRTF", "*Population", "*Landuse category 20 or 21", "High Concentration County"),
           c( "Estimate", sprintf("%.7f", spatial_model4.0$beta)), 
           c("Coefficient Interpretation", " ", "1000m increase implies 0.0071 decrease in log2 Pb.",
  "100m increase implies 0.005 decrease in",
  "1 unit increase implies 0.071 increase in",
  "1000/sq.km. increase implies 0.068 increase in log2 Pb",
  "0.085 increase in log2 Pb if landuse 20 or 21",
  "0.005 increase in log2 Pb if high concentration county."
))

spat_mod_table <- rbind(spat_mod_table, c("$\\textbf{AIC Spatial Model}$", round(AIC(spatial_model4.0),3), "", ""))
spat_mod_table <- rbind(spat_mod_table, c("$\\textbf{AIC OLS Model}$", round(AIC(model1), 3), "", ""))

spat_mod_table %>% kable(align="c", escape = F, caption = "\\label{tab:ols} Spatial model summary with variables from OLS model.(* denotes significant variables)") %>%
  kable_paper("hover", full_width = F, font_size = 10, latex_options = "hold_position")

```

A range of models with different correlation structures were used to
choose the adequate model. After accounting for the spatial
auto-correlation, the variables `Northing` and
`High Concentration County` become insignificant at 5% significance
level i.e, the effect of these variables dissipates after correlation is
added to the model and were therefore removed from the spatial model.
This effect was similar across the different models that were compared.
The model adequacy criterion chosen was $AIC$, and as such, it was
lowest for the model with exponential correlation structure, with a
value of `r round(AIC(spatial_model4.0), 3)`. Comparing that with the
$AIC$ value of the OLS model given by `r round(AIC(model1), 3)`, it was
seen that the spatial model is indeed a better fit to the data. The
smooth variation (given by partial sill $\sigma^2$), random variation or
noise (given by $\tau^2$), and the correlation distance (given by
$\phi$), as estimated by the model, were
`r round(spatial_model4.0$sigmasq, 3)`,
`r round(spatial_model4.0$nugget, 3)`, and
`r round(spatial_model4.0$phi, 3)` respectively. Nugget effect is higher
than partial sill, which when coupled with the fact that the range
parameter is low compared to the full range of distances (as shown in
the variogram figure \ref{fig:variograms}), suggested the presence of
weak spatial auto-correlation, which nevertheless needed to be accounted
for.

\newpage

## Outlier Analysis

As already stated, there were a total of 30 outliers which were labelled
by the 3-standard deviation rule. There were no unusual values for
co-variates that differed distinctively from the ones in the non-outlier
case. The topographical indices were well within range and no
interaction of co-variates explained these atypical values. However, the
distribution of number of outliers across `Landuse` categories gives
some direction, as provided in the plot \ref{fig:outlierbar}. The
importance of the categories' context is hence justified.

```{r outliers, fig.height = 3, fig.cap = '\\label{fig:outlierbar} Number of Outliers across Landuse categories.', out.width= '70%', out.height='50%', fig.align='center'}

lead_data2_outlier %>% count(Landuse) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = fct_reorder(Landuse, n), y = n)) +
  geom_col(fill = 'white', color = 'black') +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(x = 'Landuse Category', y = NULL)

```

# Research Conclusion and Discussions {#references}

The exploratory analysis along with the help of fitted models suggested
that the Lead concentration had no discernible trends in North-South or
East-West direction. Glasgow City council had the highest average level
of Pb concentration, as was expected given the rich industrial heritage
of the council. Landuse category 20 and 21 had high level of
concentration irrespective of the councils. Some clusters of
contamination were located in the maps. Glasgow City council had the
most clusters which were easily visible in the concentration map. Most
of the outliers were again from the Landuse category 20 and 21.

Evidences of correlation among the values of concentration were found,
but the degree of correlation was deemed to be weak. There was a lot of
unexplained variation in the data that was not covered by the models,
possibly because of the low predictive ability of the sampled
co-variates. Some of the major indicators of soil contamination such as
pH value, loss of ignition etc were not available, the presence of which
could have improved the explainability of the models. Nevertheless,
there were certain variables found to be statistically significant (the
most important of which is the indicator of `Landuse` category 20 or
21), but under the research context and their estimated effects, their
practical significance is questionable.

This piece of independent research work could be extended in many
segments to glean more information from the data. A map of prediction at
un-sampled locations could be provided after improving the spatial
model, possibly by including co-variates with better predictive power or
by using a more advanced predictive algorithm altogether. A clustering
algorithm that can include values of response along with easting and
northing to identify clusters could be used to discern more subtle
clusters.
